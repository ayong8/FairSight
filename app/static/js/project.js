Formatting hack to get around crispy-forms unfortunate hardcoding
in helpers.FormHelper:

    if template_pack == 'bootstrap4':
        grid_colum_matcher = re.compile('\w*col-(xs|sm|md|lg|xl)-\d+\w*')
        using_grid_layout = (grid_colum_matcher.match(self.label_class) or
                             grid_colum_matcher.match(self.field_class))
        if using_grid_layout:
            items['using_grid_layout'] = True

Issues with the above approach:

1. Fragile: Assumes Bootstrap 4's API doesn't change (it does)
2. Unforgiving: Doesn't allow for any variation in template design
3. Really Unforgiving: No way to override this behavior
4. Undocumented: No mention in the documentation, or it's too hard for me to find
